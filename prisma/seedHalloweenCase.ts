      description: 'At the notorious off-campus Halloween party known as "The Blackout Bash," popular fraternity president Tyler Morrison (21) was found dead in the basement at 1:15 AM, stabbed multiple times with a kitchen knife. The party, hosted at a rented house on Maple Street, was packed with over 200 costumed students. Tyler had been seen arguing with several people throughout the night before disappearing around 12:45 AM. His body was discovered by party-goers looking for more beer. Security was lax, drinks were flowing, and in the chaos of costumes and intoxicated students, the killer had plenty of cover. The five main suspects all had recent conflicts with Tyler and suspicious gaps in their alibis.',

The champagne reception had been in full swing when she excused herself for "fresh air" at 9:15 PM. Security footage shows all five remaining guests had opportunities to follow her outside during the critical 30-minute window. The killer is among the elite attendees, each with their own dark connection to the victim\'s scathing reviews.',
